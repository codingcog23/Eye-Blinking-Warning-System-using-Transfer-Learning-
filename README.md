<h1 align="center">🚀 Eye Blinking Warning System using Transfer Learning 🔥</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A simple prototype to count the number of times a human eye blinks AND raise warning alarm. This program could be used to count how many times a human eye blinks.</p>
<p>This prototype could be used to build sleeping detection and other medical-related computer vision applications.</p>

<h2>Technologies & Frameworks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>🐍 Python 3.8</li>
  <li>🔬 Scipy module</li>
  <li>🖼️ Imutils module</li>
  <li>🔨 Cmake module</li>
  <li>🤖 DLIB Module</li>
  <li>👁️ OpenCV Module</li>
  <li>⬇️ Wget</li>
</ul>

<h3>👉 Why Scipy?</h3>
<p>SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.</p>
<p>Note: We use SciPy module to calculate distances in eyes.</p>

<h3>👉 Why Imutils?</h3>
<p>Imutils are a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV and Python.</p>

<h3>👉 Why Cmake?</h3>
<p>The DLIB module is depended on the cmake, therefore, we should install the cmake first in order to install DLIB.</p>
<p>Cmake is cross-platform free and open-source software for build automation it is not a build system but rather it generates another system's build files.</p>

<h3>👉Why DLIB?</h3>
<p>The DLIB is the main framework that is used to build this eye detection part.</p>
<p>DLIB is a general purpose cross-platform software library written in the programming language C++. Its design is heavily influenced by ideas from design by contract and component-based software engineering. Thus it is, first and foremost, a set of independent software components.</p>

<h3>👉 Why OpenCV?</h3>
<p>OpenCV plays a major role in this project, the OpenCV accelerate the computer vision ability to this project.</p>

<h2>👉 Configuration & Setup</h2>
<p>To set up the Eye Blinking Warning System, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install OpenCV:</li>
  <pre><code>pip install opencv-python</code></pre>

  <li>Install Imutils:</li>
  <pre><code>pip install imutils</code></pre>

  <li>Install Cmake:</li>
  <pre><code>pip install cmake</code></pre>

  <li>Install DLIB:</li>
  <pre><code>pip install dlib</code></pre>

  <li>Install Wget:</li>
  <pre><code>pip install wget</code></pre>
</ol>

<p>👉🎯 Make sure to install the required dependencies to ensure smooth execution of the Eye Blinking Warning System.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore and customize the code according to your specific needs. For any questions or issues, please refer to the project documentation or reach out to the project contributors.</p>
